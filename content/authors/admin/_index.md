I am a pre-doctoral fellow in the Genetic Epidemiology Research Branch of National Institutes of Mental Health and PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of public health. My research involves developing methods to model mixed intensive longitudinal data and highly multivariate spatial data. My work has applications in wearables, ecological momentary assessment and environmental sciences. My research on physical activity got featured in Times ({{< staticref "https://time.com/4821963/teens-sedentary-lifestyle-exercise/" "newtab" >}}Teens Are Just As Sedentary As 60 Year Olds){{< /staticref >}}, Washington Post, WSJ, BBC, WPYR and others. I also like to combine my passion for soccer and statistics. You can find my multi-faceted analysis on FIFA World Cup 2018 data here: {{< staticref "https://ddey07.github.io/open-data/" "newtab" >}} The good, the bad and the ugly of the beautiful game. {{< /staticref >}}

Outside work, I likes to play soccer, indulge in culinary adventures and travel around the world.
