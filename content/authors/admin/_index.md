  ## About Me
  
  Debangan Dey is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University. His research develops statistical methods for **multivariate stochastic processes**, with a focus on integrating **digital health data** (capturing changes over time) and **environmental attributes** (varying across space). This includes modeling data from wearables and smartphones alongside contextual exposures like temperature, light, and greenspace to understand **individual-level dynamics in space and time**. His work also spans **multivariate spatial statistics**
