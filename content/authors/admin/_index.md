## About Me
  
Debangan Dey is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University. His research focuses on developing statistical theory and methods for multivariate stochastic processes, which arise in intensive, multilevel, and multimodal longitudinal dataâ€”particularly from digital health technologies (such as wearables and smartphones) and environmental monitoring. He is especially interested in integrating data that vary across both space and time, aiming to build unified frameworks for individual-level analysis, such as tracking mental health trajectories across subjects using smart devices along with environmental exposures like temperature, light, and access to greenspace. His methodological work also extends to multivariate spatial statistics, with applications in environmental health and neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI). Debangan received his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where he worked on statistical modeling and inference for complex data structures.
